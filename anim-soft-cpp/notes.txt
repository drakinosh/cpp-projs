added layers but animation has gone out of whack.
will fix it immediately.

seems problem lies in drawing multiple sprites

tried to create single image out of mutliple images
function never completes first inner loop
wonder why
possible pixel access error

^
got error because i forgot to call image and texture's "create" method.
successfully added layering

added eraser, but freezes and gives segfault on clicking.
will inspect it.

successfully added erasing mechanism; played around, no problems
so far.
(insert exclamation of joy).

note to self: playing mechanism assumes at least two layers
